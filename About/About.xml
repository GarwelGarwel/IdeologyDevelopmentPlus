	<description>Ideology Development+ overhauls development of fluid ideoligions.
	
	Features:
	
	- Acquisition of development points is doubled (by default), so you can start reforming your ideoligion earlier (but there's a caveat: see below)
	
	- Dev point cap is removed (i.e. you can accumulate as many dev points as you want)
	
	- Adding or removing most memes and precepts costs dev points
	
	- Cost of adding or removing memes scales with their impact
	
	- Some precepts cost more or less dev points than the others (e.g. faster vs slower research speeds)
	
	- For spectrum-like precepts (e.g. Cannibalism attitude), switching between nearby options costs less than jumping between opposites
	
	- Most values can be tweaked to your liking
	
	Obviously, Ideology DLC is required. So is Harmony.
	
	Should be compatible with most mods except those that also change the ideo development. May need additional patches for better balancing custom precepts.
	
	Let me know if you think the balance is off somewhere.</description>
